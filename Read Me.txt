I have successfully created a fixtures and index page

They layouts are working well and nothing is buggy.

I link the "rankings page" but I am still yet to create it"


This is going well. Next pages will be fixtures which will be a table but with a gap in the middle.


I have decided to have the current updates on every page. Every single page will maintain the same design.
In the club updates however, I will add custom content relevant to that page. They updates panel will
be a dynamic page.

I can't wait to add the javascript that sets the winner, as the individual on number 1 on the table.
